#About Me#

###Hi my name is Babak Saberi, a curious UX feature lead with a background in cognitive science. The research I conduct focuses on how people process information in complex environments like the cockpit of a vehicle. I use behavioural insights and data analytics to deliver a user experience that is both pleasant to use and productive while operating a vehicle. My goal is to translate these findings into actionable strategies that make in-vehicle systems safer and more intuitive while meeting business goals based on innovation and differentiation.##
